      <h2 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h2>
      <p>
        OpenScan is not merely a product — it is a declaration of principles for
        public blockchain infrastructure. Every decision we make is guided by a
        commitment to transparency, neutrality, and the belief that core
        infrastructure must remain a public good.
      </p>
      <p>
        These principles are non-negotiable. They define what OpenScan is and what it will never compromise on.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-trustlessness-matters">Why Trustlessness Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Every system begins with good intentions.
        A hosted node here, a whitelisted relayer there. <br />
        Each is harmless on its own — and together they become habit. <br />
        Gateways become platforms. <br />
        Platforms become landlords. <br />
        Landlords decide who may enter and what they may do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only defense is trustless design: systems whose correctness and fairness depend only on  <br />
        math and consensus, never on the goodwill of intermediaries. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Trustlessness is not a feature to add after the fact. <br />
        It is the thing itself. <br />
        Without it, everything else — efficiency, UX, scalability — is decoration on a fragile core.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blockchain ecosystem has made remarkable progress in decentralizing
        consensus and computation, yet one crucial piece remains centralized: the
        interface between users and on-chain data. This is more than a technical
        gap — it&apos;s a trust gap. OpenScan exists to close it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="three-laws">The Three Laws of Trustless Design</h2>
      <p>
        A trustless design must obey three laws. They are harsh — they limit what
        we can build easily. But they are the only guarantee that what we build
        belongs to everyone.

        Revenue is sourced from projects, networks, and builders that recognize

      <h2 id="the-pledge">The Pledge</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We choose to build trustless systems even when it is harder. <br />
          We pay the cost of openness over the convenience of control. <br />
          We do not outsource neutrality to anyone who can be bribed, coerced, or shut down.<br />
          We measure success not by transactions per second, but by trust reduced per transaction.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          We refuse to build on infrastructure we cannot replace.<br />
          We refuse to call a system &ldquo;permissionless&rdquo; when only the privileged can participate.<br />
          We refuse to trade autonomy for polish, or freedom for frictionless UX.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your protocol requires faith in an intermediary, change it.<br />
          If it relies on a private gateway, replace it.<br />
          If it hides critical state or logic offchain, expose it.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the world does not need more efficient middlemen.<br />
          It needs fewer reasons to trust them.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The designs will change. The principles will not.
